# attempt1
first attempt to add firebase to an android and iOS app
This failed misserably - I started by creating a repository in git and all it had was this README.md file

I need a VS Code project with a all the basic files! but how do I then commit it to github.com? I tried going
the other way but when I commited, it didn't show up on github.com! WTF!!!??
